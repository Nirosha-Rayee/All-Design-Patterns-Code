//Letâ€™s see how we can implement builder design pattern in java:
//First of all you need to create a static nested class and then copy all the arguments from the outer class to the Builder class.
// We should follow the naming convention and if the class name is Student then builder class should be named as StudentBuilder.
//Java Builder class should have a public constructor with all the required attributes as parameters.i.e in StudentBuilder class.
//Java Builder class should have methods to set the optional parameters and it should return the same Builder object after setting the optional attribute.
//The final step is to provide a build() method in the builder class that will return the Object needed by client program.
// For this we need to have a private constructor in the Class with Builder class as argument in Student class.


//The builder pattern is a design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions.
// The construction is controlled by a director object that only needs to know the type of object it is to create.

//Note: Notice that Student class has only getter methods and no public constructor.
// So the only way to get a Student object is through the StudentBuilder class.
